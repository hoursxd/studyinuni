# StudyInUni
StudyInUni is an app helping you get motivated and stay focused on your study in a virtual university setting.

# Inspiration
People lost motivation to study while staying alone. As Universities go virtual, most students have been staying home alone and their mental health conditions fluctuate due to physical distancing and reduced face to face communication. With StudyInUni, we are boosting people's motivation and productivity.

# What is StudyInUni?
StudyInUni is an app helping you get motivated and stay focused on your study in a virtual university setting.

# Usage
Using StudyInUni is as simple as attending a virtual university. You can enter a building or a library and choose a classroom to study. There are general rooms and specific course classrooms. You can sit in a classroom to stay focused and be counted for the study time as well as seeing other students sitting in the classroom to gain motivation. You can move to other classrooms when you feel to change your environment/study subject :D.

# How it was built
Django for the backend, MySQL as database, Bootstrap and GreenSock for the frontend, Azure VM as the cloud server.

We scraped units of study and its associated time from USYD UOS site for name and countdown of the classrooms and stored them in MySQL database with a Django backend. A queue is invoked to ensure all students will have a place to study.

Bootstrap is used in the frontend for easy and faster development of User interface elements. GreenSock framework is leveraged to animate the web, make the interface vivid, and allow for a smoother user experience.
